# DiseaseSpreadingModels

Project for FYTN03 Computational Physics at Lundy University

It's 2020, and every physicist has become a hobby-epidemologist. Today it is our turn. 

Models:
-SIS (Suseptible-Infected-Suseptible)
-SIR (Suseptible-Infected-Resistant)
-SIR with traveling (add different populations with traveling coeff )

Methods
-Euler
    -(Richardsom Extrapolation)
-RK (4th order)

Error
-Num error estimet for O(h^m) algorithm
